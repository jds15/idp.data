                 who="http://papyri.info/editor/users/simoeis">Vote - AcceptText - Nothing to add to Cowey's comments, except on the following readings:  ln 4, as stated by Cowey, probably better to retain Καίσα̣ρ(ος) of ed.pr.; ostrakon seems to preserve original right edge, thus there is not likely to be letters missing there.  This applies also to κριθ̣ῆ̣ς̣ (the reading of the ed.pr.) at end of ln 6.  ln 8, it is agreed that the year number should have no overstrokes, which was probably a typo since neither the ed.pr. nor O.Petr. Mus. prints it.  I would keep the stroke over κε at the end of the line.  It is printed in both editions and seems to be (partially) visible on the image.</change>

                 who="http://papyri.info/editor/users/james.cowey">Vote - AcceptText - lin1 illegible from the image as far as I am concerned but new reading plausible; lin2 illegible (apart from the first 5 letters) from the image as far as I am concerned but transcription is as in the ed.pr.; lin3 (apart from first 4 letters) illegible from the image as far as I am concerned but transcription offered has parallels from other ostraca such as O.Petr.Mus. 220 as noted by the editor the same applies to lin4; lin4 Καίσα̣ρ[ος ?] should either be Καίσα̣ρ[ος] [?] or Καίσα̣ρ[ος] ed. pr. had Καίσα̣ρ(ος) which might be preferable. I can see αίσ and space for two letters perhaps then the edge of the ostracon so that the original reading Καίσα̣ρ(ος) may indeed be better. lin6 κριθ̣ῆ̣[ς̣ ?] should either be κριθ̣ῆ̣[ς] [?] or κριθ̣ῆ̣[ς], but perhaps the reading κριθ̣ῆ̣ς̣ of the ed.pr. is better because the edge of the ostracon is visible and Verschleifung may have been used to end the word in the tight space available; lin7 seems fine; lin8 remove the overstrokes on the numeral associated with the year they were not in the edition I cannot see them on the image and they would be unusual anyway. lin8 I would remove the overstrokes on the numeral which indicates the day date because I do not see them on the image, although they were added in the ed.pr. and also in the re-edition.</change>
