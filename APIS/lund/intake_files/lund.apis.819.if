cu561 | 1 | According to the introduction to his licentiate dissertation Erik J. Knudtzon had acquired the ostracon collection through prof. Carl Schmidt, antiquities dealer and professor of Coptic studies in Berlin. Carl Schmidt, in his turn, had probably bought them in Cairo. In a letter from October 6th 1931 Schmidt writes from Berlin to Albert Wifstrand in Lund that he has aquired a small collection of 32 ostraca from Thebes, Fayum, letters and receipts, and that he is willing to sell these ostraca for the amount of 250 German marks. In a letter dated September 11th 1934 from Erik Knudtzon in Lund, most likely to professor Schubart in Berlin, we can read that Knudtzon bought the ostraca through Carl Schmidt at the same time, i.e. in 1932, as the university library in Lund bought the papyrus collection (registered in 1933 among acquisitions), also from Carl Schmidt. In 2009 Lund University Library acquired the collection, at that time owned by the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at the same university.
